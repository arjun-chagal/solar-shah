# solar-shah

This repository will be an implementation of solar energy generation prediction using ML algorithms. 

The idea is to use data from single axis tracker(SAT) solar panels, such as the power output of panel and any other sensor readings, along with weather API's and (possibly) the position of the sun to predict how much power can be generated in the future by these panels.

Once the predictive model is developed, its success rate can be deduced and further improvements can be made to the predictive models.
